Richards equation on porous media

This project aims to solve ground flow problems (based on Richard's equation) in 
porous media. 

One of the focus of this project is to develop general surrogate model (data driven and reduced order model) solutions to the 
ground flow problems.  
THUS, the code is developed in a way to be easily understood and modified.
Efficiency is not the priority and further vectorization is required if code efficiency is highly demanded.


Finished code.
